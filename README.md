<h2 align="center">Hello there! My name is Ichan Kabir. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"></h2>
I'm a 2nd year undergraduate at National Institute of Technology, Silchar. I love to explore and learn new things and have the ability to work whole night.
  
I have a keen  interest in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligent. ðŸŒ±I'm, currently learning `machine learning` and have made two simple projects-- Linear regression and Logistic regression. In these projects I have used popular machine learning libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn.

Besides these I'm fond of playing online games, natural photography and movies.
