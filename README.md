I'm a 2nd year undergraduate at National Institute of Technology, Silchar. I love to explore and learn new things and have the ability to work whole night. I also love to solve  problems on [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com/ikabir/) and [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/mrwizard/).


I have a keen  interest in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligent. 🌱I'm, currently learning `machine learning` and have made two simple projects-- Linear regression and Logistic regression. In these projects I have used popular machine learning libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.

Besides these I'm fond of playing online games, natural photography and movies.
